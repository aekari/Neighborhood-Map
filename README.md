##### Resources

- [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/). I added a full-sized map using Google Maps API key and [Foursquare Developer Tools](https://developer.foursquare.com/).
- [Knockout JS](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html">Knockout.js).  I used Knockout JS's framework to manage the list of locations. This was extremely useful with tracking click events and other editable/changable elements. [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) was also used for this project.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) was helpful for looking up information for random things I did not know right away.
-[Node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/foursquare-venue-lat-lng) was used in order to grab the FourSquare lat. and lng. coordinates using the foursquare-venue-lat-lng package.
