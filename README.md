##### Resources

- [Google Maps Javascript API](href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial">Google Maps Javascript API). I added a full-sized map using Google Maps API key and [Foursquare Developer Tools](https://developer.foursquare.com/).
- [Knockout JS](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html">Knockout.js).  I used Knockout JS's framework to manage the list of locations. This was extremely useful with tracking click events and other editable/changable elements. [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) was also used for this project.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) was helpful for looking up information for random things I did not know right away.
